## v0.5.0 — Stockfish Nightmare Release

**Status:** Released

### Added

- **Nightmare difficulty (~2000):** Powered by Stockfish WASM — a real chess engine running in your browser via WebAssembly. Uses the `stockfish.wasm@0.10.0` package (the same one Lichess uses).
- **Lazy loading:** Stockfish WASM (~150KB gzipped, ~400KB total with worker) is dynamically imported *only* when the user selects Nightmare difficulty. Not loaded on app startup.
- **StockfishEngine wrapper** (`src/chess/stockfish.ts`): UCI protocol integration with state management, progress reporting (depth/score), error handling, and proper resource cleanup.
- **Progress display:** Status bar shows "Nightmare dX | ±Y.ZZ" while Stockfish is thinking, with real-time depth and evaluation updates.
- **Loading states:** UI shows "Loading Stockfish engine…" while the WASM binary is downloading and initializing.
- **Error handling:** If Stockfish fails to load (e.g., missing SharedArrayBuffer support), the error is displayed in the UI.
- **Browser compatibility check:** `isWasmThreadsSupported()` utility function in the Stockfish wrapper.
- **Vercel deployment headers:** `vercel.json` with `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` and `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin` required for SharedArrayBuffer.
- **Dev server headers:** Vite config configured with COOP/COEP headers for local development.
- **Nightmare warning in UI:** Difficulty selector shows a warning note about SharedArrayBuffer requirements when Nightmare is selected.

### Changed

- **Difficulty type** — `'nightmare'` added to the `Difficulty` union type.
- **DIFFICULTIES config** — Nightmare entry now active with `usesStockfish: true` and a descriptive description.
- **DIFFICULTY_OPTIONS** — Nightmare added to the selector dropdown.
- **useChessGame hook** — Supports Stockfish lifecycle (init/terminate/search), Stockfish move integration, and progress tracking.
- **StatusBar component** — New props for Stockfish status, error, progress, and Nightmare indicator.
- **App component** — Passes Stockfish state through to StatusBar.
- **DifficultySelector** — Shows SharedArrayBuffer warning when Nightmare is selected.
- **package.json** — Version bumped to 0.5.0.
- **vite.config.ts** — Added COOP/COEP headers and excluded `stockfish.wasm` from optimizeDeps.
- **SECURITY.md** — Updated to note Stockfish is a local engine with no network calls.

### Integration Details

- Stockfish WASM uses SharedArrayBuffer + Web Workers for threading (single thread configured for compatibility).
- Engine configured with 16MB hash and 1 thread.
- ~2.5 seconds think time per move for Nightmare difficulty.
- Engine is terminated when switching away from Nightmare or unmounting the app.

### Browser Compatibility

Nightmare difficulty requires a modern browser with:
- WebAssembly threading support
- `SharedArrayBuffer`
- `Atomics` API
- Proper COOP/COEP HTTP headers

Supported browsers: Chrome 79+, Edge 79+, Firefox 79+. Not supported on Safari or mobile browsers.

## v0.4.0 — Gameplay Product Polish Release

**Status:** Released

### Added

- **Background texture:** Warm carpet texture background with semi-transparent warm beige/cream overlays for a cozy, premium feel.
- **Warm UI theme:** Updated CSS variables with warmer tones, backdrop-filter blur effects on cards, and box shadows to make UI elements pop against the texture.
- **Undo Move:** Undo the last move (or last 2 moves in computer mode). Game state, history, and FEN are properly restored.
- **Restart Game:** Restart button with confirmation dialog. Resets all game state.
- **Resign Game:** Resign button with confirmation dialog. Shows "White/Black resigned — Black/White wins!" message.
- **PGN Export:** Export game as PGN. Copy to clipboard and download as `.pgn` file.
- **Captured Pieces Display:** Two-row display showing captured white pieces (by black) and captured black pieces (by white), sorted by value.
- **Move Review / Step-Through Mode:** Browse move history after or during a game. Previous/next navigation, clickable move rows, highlights current move, and a "Exit Review" button. Review mode is display-only and does not corrupt game state.
- **Board Theme Selector:** Five board color themes — Classic, Marine, Ember, Forest, Midnight. Persisted to localStorage.
- **Multiple Piece Sets:** Three piece rendering styles — Unicode (default), Symbols (warm golden/amber), Outlined (transparent with stroke). Persisted to localStorage.
- **Sound Effects (Web Audio API):** Programmatic sounds for moves, captures, checks, checkmate, promotions, and illegal moves. No audio files needed. Sound on/off toggle in Settings.
- **Better Mobile Layout:** Controls below board on mobile (<640px), 44px minimum touch targets, board width `min(92vw, 400px)`, full-width settings overlay on mobile, collapsible move history.

### Changed

- **AppSettings** — Added `boardTheme`, `pieceSet`, `soundEnabled` fields. Updated defaults and persistence.
- **Settings panel** — Added board theme selector, piece set selector, sound on/off toggle.
- **Layout** — Captured pieces bar above board. Review controls in move history.
- **CSS overhaul** — Warmer color palette, backdrop-filter blur, texture background, board theme variables, piece set CSS classes, mobile improvements.
- **README.md** — Updated feature table, added sound/theme/piece set/mobile sections.
- **CHANGELOG updated** with v0.4.0 entry.

## v0.3.1 — Engine Validation & Optimization Release

**Status:** Released

### Fixed

- **Quiescence search:** Removed redundant `qsearchMinimal` wrapper, combined into single `quiescenceSearch`. Explicit promotions handling in tactical move list. Fixed delta pruning margin to use piece-value-based threshold instead of arbitrary 200cp.
- **Mobility evaluation:** Replaced `approximateMobility()` (crude piece-counting that ignored pins/checks) with `countAttackedSquares()` — iterates the board and counts squares attacked by each piece. Simpler and significantly more accurate for the non-turning side.
- **King safety:** Rewrote `kingSafetyScore`. Fixed center distance formula (now `|kf - 3.5| + |kr - 3.5|` regardless of color). Removed stale `pawnDir` comments and dead code. Castling detection now checks corner position + front pawns.
- **Move ordering:** Replaced fake check detection (`captured === 'k'`) with real `givesCheck()` using clone-and-move. Applied to top 8 moves only to control cost.
- **Transposition table:** Upgraded from djb2 to FNV-1a hashing for better distribution. Added FEN verification field in TTEntry to detect/reject hash collisions. Increased table size from 262144 to 524288 entries.

### Added

- **Opening book:** ~35 common opening lines (Italian, Ruy Lopez, Scotch, Sicilian, French, Caro-Kann, Queen's Gambit, Indian Defenses, English) stored as UCI move sequences. Used by Club (up to 6 plies) and Expert (up to 10 plies).
- **Endgame evaluation:** When total non-king material drops below 1800cp — king centralization bonus, rook open-file bonus (+15 open, +10 semi-open), opposite-colored bishops drawishness adjustment (−50cp when few other pieces remain), extra passed pawn bonus.
- **Node budget:** CLUB_MAX_NODES=30000, EXPERT_NODES_PER_ITERATION=80000 to cap search effort.
- **Browser yielding:** Every 500 nodes, yields to the event loop via `setTimeout(0)` to prevent browser freezing during Expert search.
- **Engine benchmark utility:** `src/chess/bench.ts` — tests 6 positions across difficulty levels with timing, timeout protection, and formatted output. Run with `npx tsx src/chess/bench.ts [casual|club|expert]`.

### Changed

- **Search optimization:** Switched from `new Chess(game.fen())` clones to `game.move()`/`game.undo()` pattern for search traversal. Avoids creating thousands of new Chess objects per search.
- **Evaluation weight tuning:**
  - Mobility weight: 5 → 3 (10 extra moves = 30cp instead of 50cp)
  - Doubled pawn penalty: −15 → −20
  - Isolated pawn penalty: −20 → −25
  - Passed pawn base: +10 → +20, per-rank increment: +20 → +15
  - Castled bonus: 20 → 30
  - Pawn shield max: 12 → 15
  - Close file penalty: 15 → 20
  - Center control: 10 → 8 per square
  - Development: centralized bonus 15 → 20, back-rank penalty 15 → 20

### Performance

- Expert search now yields every 500 nodes with a global node budget, preventing browser freezes
- Club search capped at 30K nodes total
- Move/undo pattern reduces Chess object allocations by ~90%+ compared to per-node cloning
- FNV-1a hash reduces TT collision rate vs. djb2

### Documentation

- CHANGELOG updated with v0.3.1 entry
- README updated with v0.3.1 details

## v0.3.0 — Engine Strength Release

**Status:** Released

### Added

- **Expert difficulty (~1700)** with 5-ply iterative deepening search, transposition caching (262K-entry table), and quiescence search
- **Quiescence search** for tactical stability at search horizons (captures + promotions searched until quiet positions)
- **Transposition table cache** for Expert difficulty — avoids re-searching positions and provides best-move hints for ordering
- **MVV-LVA move ordering** (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Attacker) for better alpha-beta pruning efficiency
- **Improved evaluation:**
  - **Mobility counting** — approximate legal move counts for each piece type (Club+)
  - **Pawn structure** — doubled pawn penalty (−15), isolated pawn penalty (−20), passed pawn bonus (+10–70)
  - **Piece development** — bonuses for developed knights/bishops, penalties for undeveloped back-rank pieces (Club+)
  - **Space advantage** — center and extended-center square control (Club+)
  - **Improved king safety** — pawn shield at two depths, castled king bonus, open file penalty, center-penalty in middlegame

### Changed

- **Club difficulty upgraded:** now 3-ply + quiescence search with MVV-LVA ordering and full evaluation (was 2-ply without quiescence)
- **Casual evaluation** now passes proper evaluation features config instead of always using defaults
- Evaluation function now takes a configurable `EvalFeatures` parameter per difficulty level
- Engine architecture refactored for cleaner separation — quiescence, move ordering, and transposition logic extracted to dedicated modules

### Disabled
